DEPRECATED BRANCH
Note that this branch has been deprecated. We'll be deploying the 
prototype on Heroku which provides db-as-a-service based on PostgreSQL. 
Therefore it was prudent to change the database management system on 
which SeaIce is based. The code in this branch is based on MySQL and 
development is frozen as of 6/20/13. 

That being said, here's the old README.

Thus far, the SeaIce metadictionary consists of a database API, a 
command line tool called "sea", and an HTTP server frontend called "ice". 
Before you get started, you need to set up a database and some software 
packages. On Ubuntu, grab the follwoing:
  
  python-flask . . . . . . . Simple HTTP server.

  mysql-server . . . . . . . We're using MySQL as our database for the 
                             moment. 

  python-mysqldb . . . . . . Python API for MySQL.

  python-pip . . . . . . . . Package manager for additional Python 
                             programs. 

We need to download a package from pip that handles configuration files
nicely. Do: 

  $ sudo pip install configparser

Now set up a database in MySQL: 

  $ mysql --user=USER --password=PASS
  mysql> create database DBNAME (such as seaice) 
  mysql> commit
  mysql> exit

Lastly, create a configuration file for the database and user account
you set up. Create a file called ~/.seaice like: 

  [default]
  dbname = seaice
  user = USER
  password = PASS1
  [viewer]
  dbname = seaice
  user = viewer
  password = PASS2
  [contributor]
  dbname = seaice
  user = contributor
  password = PASS3

Set the correct file permissions with: 

  $ chmod 600 ~/.seaice

Then you should be good to go! To test everything is sane, do: 

  $ ./sea --init-db

To run the WebUI, do 
 
  $ ./ice
  
Open your browser and go to "localhost:5000". Have fun! -Chris
